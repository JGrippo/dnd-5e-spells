# DnD 5e API

This is an API I'm working on to provide developers with information about the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons. It is built using NodeJS and hopefully will grow to include all information about the game. Right now, I am just working with the spells.

I hope to build this to a point that it becomes easier for other developers to build tools for players and game masters.
