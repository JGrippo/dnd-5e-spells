# DnD 5e Spells

This application helps display and organize spells for Dungeons and Dragons 5e. It includes an API to query spells as well as a frontend that has a number of features. This project is a work in progress to provide for features in both the server and client architectures. The goal is to create a tool that makes it easier to organize resources for players and game masters. I hope to also develop the API further to help other developers make cool things.
